Addition of two large integers :

1.  Generating 2 arrays A and B of size atleast 16000
2.  Selecting number of threads and blocks for the addition to run on using ceiling on the size of A and B i.e threads required 
    = ceiling(size(A)/threads_per_block) * threads_per_block
3.  Generating arrays A and B randomly on CPU and copying to GPU memory
4.  The 2 arrays on GPU and storing its value in C (another array)
5   Copying everything back to CPU and printing out the values
