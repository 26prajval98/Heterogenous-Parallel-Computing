Questions.
1.   Were there any difficulties you had with completing the optimization correctly.
Ans. Nope.

2.   Which optimizations gave the most benifit.
Ans. atomicAdd 

3.   For the histogram kernel, how many global memory reads are being performed by your kernel? explain.
Ans. Number of global memory reads are equal to the number of elements in the input array.

4.   For the histogram kernel, how many global memory writes are being performed by your kernel? explain.
Ans. The number of global memory writes are equal to the number of elements in the input array.

5.   For the histogram kernel, how many atomic operations are being performed by your kernel? explain.
Ans. Every thread performs an atomicAdd, thus size of input array.

6.   Most text files will consist of only letters, numbers and whitespace characters. These 95 characters
     make up fall between ASCII numbers 32 - 126. What can we say about atomic access contention if more than
     95 threads are simultaneously trying to atomically increment a private histogram?
Ans. Atomic access leads to sequential working of threads. 95 threads contending will slow down the process 
     and we need tofind better optimisations like having private bins for a block.
