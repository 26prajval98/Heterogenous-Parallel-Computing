Questions.
    
1.   Are there places in your solution where there is an implicit memory copy between the host and device (a copy that is not from thrust::copy)?
Ans. Yes. ( thrust::device_vector<int> deviceBins(hostBins, hostBins + num_bins);  in LINE 59)

2.   What is the asympotic runtime of this approach to histogram ("bigO" time)?
Ans. Sorting: O(nlogn)
     Cumulative histogram (Essentially does binary search for every elemnt):  O(n*logn)
     Adjacent difference: O(n)
   
     Total: O(nlogn)

3.   What is the asympotic runtime of the privatized atomic approach to histogram?
Ans. O(n) for read, updation in private histogram and write on the global histogram

4.   Why might the developers of Thrust not provide a straightforward interface?
Ans. Histogram sort is done when the number of histogram bins is larger than the size of input data. 
     For eg, in the given question, the number of bins is 128, but the data size is only 11.
