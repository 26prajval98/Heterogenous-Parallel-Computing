Questions

1.   How many global memory reads does your program make?
Ans. Each thread performs atleast 1 (to load the corresponding element into shared memory) and atmost 4 global memory reads (The other three global memory 
     reads is for the corner elements)

2.   How many shared memory reads does your program make?
Ans. Each thread performs atleast 3 (in the case of corner elements) and atmost 6 shared memory reads (for those well within the shared memory)

4.   Does your stencil make more, equal, or fewer memory accesses than the equivalent 3x3 convolution code would?
Ans. The minimum dimensions for a 3D mask is (3,3,3). The number of floating point operations each thread will perform will be approximately 27, 
     which is much higher than the 7 floating point operations performed by each thread for a stencil.
